- **Integration:** Optionally, fetch news from external regulatory sources via RSS/API for automatic updates.

#### Events Feature
- **Backend:** Add database support for events (name, date/time, description, location, registration link).
- **Frontend:** Create an events calendar/list page, with upcoming/past events and filters.
- **Admin Panel:** Allow creation and management of events, including notifications to users.
- **Integration:** Connect with external calendars (e.g. Google Calendar) or regulatory event feeds if available.

### Other Improvements
- **Backend API Integration:** Move from in-memory/context data to persistent storage using Node.js/Express or serverless API.
- **User Management:** Add multi-factor authentication, email verification, and user profile management.
- **Advanced Search:** Integrate ElasticSearch or Algolia for full-text and semantic search.
- **Notifications:** Add in-app and email notifications for document updates, events, or policy changes.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Further optimize UI/UX for mobile and tablet users.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure WCAG compliance for all users.
- **Analytics:** Integrate dashboards for regulatory bodies to monitor usage and compliance trends.
